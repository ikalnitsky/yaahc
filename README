                 yet another adaptive huffman coding

    ~ What is adaptive huffman coding?

      Adaptive Huffman coding is an adaptive coding technique based
      on Huffman coding. It permits building the code as the symbols
      are being transmitted, having no initial knowledge of source
      distribution, that allows one-pass encoding and adaptation to
      changing conditions in data.


    ~ What is YaAHC?

      YaAHC is an easy C++ library that implements FGK algorithm
      of the adaptive huffman coding. The library was implemented
      especially for university course of the compressing algorithms.


    ~ How to build?

      The library use the CMake tool for generating makefile.
      So you should do the following commands:

          $ mkdir build/ && cd build/
          $ cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
          $ make

      If you want to build tests, you should use `BUILD_TESTS` option.
      For instance:

          $ cmake ../ -DBUILD_TESTS=ON

      Make sure Boost Testing Framework was installed before. The tests
      can be run with the following command:

          $ make tests

      BTW, you can build samples with the `BUILD_SAMPLES` flag.

          $ cmake ../ -DBUILD_SAMPLES=ON
